        <h1>About Code Snippet Generator</h1>
        <p>Code Snippet Generator is a web application designed to assist developers in generating code snippets quickly and efficiently. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to understand user input and generate corresponding code snippets.</p>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> The frontend of the web application is built using HTML and CSS for structure and styling.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is used for interactivity and DOM manipulation on the client-side.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo:</strong> OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model is used for generating code snippets based on user input.</li>
            <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Docker is used for containerization, allowing for easy deployment and scalability of the application.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Code Snippet Generator provides a user-friendly web interface where developers can input a description of their coding problem. The application then interacts with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate a corresponding code snippet based on the user's input. Users can also provide feedback on the generated code snippets.</p>
        <p>Code Snippet Generator is a small personal project aimed at providing developers with a convenient tool for generating code snippets. However, it's important to note that this project has certain limitations and a relatively small scope. One of the primary limitations is the constraint on the maximum number of tokens that can be generated by the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Due to the constraint, the generated snippets may not cover complex or lengthy coding scenarios. Additionally, this project utilizes a personal API key for accessing the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. While this allows for experimentation and personal use, it is not suitable for high-traffic or production environments. It's recommended to use appropriate API key management practices and consider scalability and security implications when deploying the application in a production setting. Overall, while the generator serves as a useful tool, it's important to recognize its limitations and the scope of its intended use as a small personal project. </p>
